Linked list.

A simple linked list implementation

Finer points:
	-Uses "dummy" start and end objects
	-implemeted using c++ templates to allow for use with many different payload types
	-stores _actual_ objects on heap, instead of pointers to objects, to reduce likelyhood of pointer errors

Other:
	-included are some tests, and a test program which I wrote while writing the ll to test it (obv...)
