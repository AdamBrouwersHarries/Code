A Simple "little man computer" simulator

this is a simple implementation, in c, of the "little man computer" model.
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer)

to run the program with a file of LMC instructions call the program as follows:
	lmc.exe instructions_file
	
to compile the program run the following instructions:
	standard:
	gcc lmc.c -o lmc -Wall
	minimal:
	gcc lmc_minimal.c -o lmc_m -Wall
	

There are two versions of the simulator here, the standard (lmc.c) and the minimal version (lmc_minimal.c).
The minimal version has less verbose commenting, and outputs less while the program is running, and without delays. This makes it faster, but less information about the running of the program is exposed to the user, making the standard version better for learning (about the running, and the structure of the program), but the minimal version better for running an actual program.

breakdown of files:
code files:
	lmc.c - standard version
	lmc_minimal.c - minimal version
instruction files:
	addition.txt - instructions to add two user inputted numbers
	difference.txt - finds the difference bettween two user inputted numbers
	loop.txt - counts down to 0 from a user inputted number
binaries are included without warranty in the "bin" folder
