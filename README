Spare and useful code I've collected and written during my time.

What's here:
	-simple linked list class, which needs a lot of work to be useful.
	-simple "little man computer" simulator, including a minimal (uncommented) version in 78 lines of c.

TODO:
	-Rewrite the linked list class using templates
	-Rewrite the node class to use templates and allow it to store informtaion
	-Write wrapper class for general pathfinding?
